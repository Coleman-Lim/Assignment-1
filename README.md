# Clean Bandit Official
The application is a website for the band 'Clean Bandit"

CSS:
The website hosts a variety of features for users to enjoy. The social media buttons are clickable to direct any potential users to their music on spotify and youtube. Since "Clean Bandit" incoporates more of those bright and vibrant colours in their music videos, i feel that the colours chosen for my CSS is relevant to their main theme.

Purpose:
The main purpose of this website is to group "Clean Bandits" most popular songs to show users, a section where users can explore more about the group and it's members through the band's history, accolades that they have won in the past, and a playlist section where users can listen to all the music they have ever produced, whether it's a single/album/remix or orginal version, users can enjoy all of the band's music. Lastly, the application features a live concert map that showcases the venue and date where "Clean Bandit" would be touring, as well as to purchase their tickets for any upcoming concerts.

Javascript feature:
